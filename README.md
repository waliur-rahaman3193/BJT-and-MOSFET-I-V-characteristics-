# IV Characteristics of BJT and MOSFET

This repository contains simulation files and analysis of the **I-V (Current-Voltage) Characteristics** of **BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors)** and **MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors)**.

## Features
- Simulated using **TINA-TI**, a powerful circuit simulation tool.
- Includes visualizations and insights into the behavior of BJTs and MOSFETs under different input conditions.
- Useful for understanding key parameters:
  - **BJTs**: Cutoff, saturation, and active regions.
  - **MOSFETs**: Enhancement and depletion modes.

## Contents
1. **Simulation Files**:
   - `.TSC` files for easy simulation in TINA-TI.
2. **Graphs**:
   - Current vs. Voltage (I-V) plots for both BJTs and MOSFETs.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Explanation of observed results and their relevance to practical circuit design.

## Applications
- Academic reference for students studying transistors.
- Basis for understanding transistor operation in real-world circuits.

## Getting Started
